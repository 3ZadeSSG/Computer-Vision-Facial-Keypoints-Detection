IMPORTANT: There is no exception handling here in main.py and model.py as Node.js logs the stderr and user only needs to know there was server error
As there might be compatibility issues, resource related errors when pytorch model is loaded, hence only internal server error needs to be shown.

Still exception checks can be added if required.
